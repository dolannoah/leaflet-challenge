This project visualizes recent earthquakes with magnitudes 4.5+ using Leaflet.js, D3, and GeoJSON data from the USGS. 
Earthquakes are displayed as circle markers on an interactive map, centered around Chicago (zoom Out to see world data) styled by depth and sized by magnitude. 
Users can toggle between base maps, view tectonic plate boundaries, and explore data using popups and a legend.
